# Breakout-Game
Hello! This is breakout game developed using core methods of PYTHON.
Basically breakout game typically have one paddle, ball and bricks. when we start game ball moves toward paddle and we settle paddle beneath ball to bounce it back otherwise one life will be lost (we have 3 lives in total).
when ball bounce back from paddle it moves toward bricks (which are 100 in total).
when ball hits brick it break the brick and bounce back and same process process repeats.
Game ends with two conditions, if there is no brick left (win) or all 3 lives lost (lose).

There are TWO files in this repository one is "breakout.py" and other is "breakoutgraphics.py".
"breakoutgraphics.py" contains all working of game and "breakout.py" contain code that is used to run the game.
